# CheckMate 

## What is CheckMate?

CheckMate is the Jupyter Notebook code clone detection application for professors and teachers.

## Why we used CodeBERT?
- State-of-the-art embeddings for code representation.
- Pre-trained on massive datasets of code (Python, Java, etc.).
- Supports extracting embeddings for code snippets to compute cosine similarity directly.
- Available with HuggingFace's Transformers library, which makes it easy to use.
